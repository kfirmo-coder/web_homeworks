Hi!
Welcome to our first project about HTML and CSS.

In this project we used four different approaches to build the same layout, all with the help of GitHub Copilot (except the fully manual page):

Plain CSS (manual) – built entirely by hand to understand the core fundamentals of HTML structure and basic CSS, without any AI assistance.

Plain CSS (Copilot) – the same layout created using plain CSS with GitHub Copilot, demonstrating how AI can assist while still relying on classic CSS techniques.

Flexbox (Copilot) – implemented using CSS Flexbox with GitHub Copilot to create a modern, clean, and responsive layout more efficiently.

Bootstrap (Copilot) – built using Bootstrap’s grid system with GitHub Copilot to rapidly produce a responsive and consistent layout with minimal custom CSS.

This project compares manual development with AI-assisted approaches and highlights the strengths of each method.
